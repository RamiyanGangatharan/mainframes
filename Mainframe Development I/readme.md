# INFT 2200 (MAINFRAME DEVELOPMENT I)

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of COBOL programming projects developed as part of the INFT 2200 course - Mainframe Development I, offered at Durham College during the 2023-2024 academic year. The course serves as an introduction to developing application programs and systems for Mainframe computing, focusing on COBOL application programming. It covers language basics, control structures, multiple output files, minor totals, and arrays, with an emphasis on lab problems to provide a solid foundation in problem analysis, program design, and implementation.

## Course Description
INFT 2200 is the first of two courses dedicated to Mainframe development, aimed at equipping students with the skills needed for COBOL application programming. Alongside COBOL, the course introduces the basics of mainframe architecture and Job Control Language (JCL), preparing students for a variety of programming situations and languages.

## Projects Overview
Each project in this repository corresponds to an assignment or a significant learning milestone as outlined in the course. The projects are designed to fulfill the course learning outcomes (CLOs), focusing on writing syntactically correct COBOL code, constructing batch application programs, testing for functional requirements, generating documentation, and utilizing an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) efficiently.

### Learning Outcomes
- **CLO1:** Write COBOL source code that adheres to syntax rules and coding standards.
- **CLO2:** Construct batch application programs in COBOL to meet business functional requirements.
- **CLO3:** Test batch application programs using defined test cases.
- **CLO4:** Generate clear and concise documentation for programs.
- **CLO5:** Install, troubleshoot, and operate IDE (IBM Developer for Z/OS) and required packages for COBOL programming.

### Essential Employability Skills
This course also emphasizes several essential employability skills (EES), such as:
- effective communication (EES1, EES2)
- problem-solving (EES4, EES5)
- information management (EES6, EES7)
- personal management skills (EES11).

### Evaluation Criteria
Projects are evaluated based on a variety of criteria including code syntax, functionality, documentation, and the ability to meet specified requirements. Assignments contribute to the overall course grade, with detailed feedback provided to foster improvement.
